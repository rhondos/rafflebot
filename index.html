    <h1>Twitch Rafflebot with Bad Luck Protection</h1>
    <p>If you're hosting plenty of giveaways in your stream (For instance, World of Warcraft Dungeon Keys, or Raffle for playing with you etc.) and give loyal viewers who enter every giveaway a little bit more luck, this might be the bot for you =)</p>
    <p>The commands are: !raffle (to join the raffle) !tickets (to see how many tickets you got), the rest for the streamer is in the user interface of the bot :)</p>
    <p><strong>THIS IS JUST A TRIAL VERSION! It will only work till June 1 2023! If you want the full version, it will cost 5â‚¬ a month - for more info send me an email (Rhondos1988@gmail.com) or contact me on Twitch (Rhondos)</strong></p>
